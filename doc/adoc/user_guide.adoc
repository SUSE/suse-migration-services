== Concept
The Distribution Migration System provides an upgrade path for an
installed SUSE Linux Enterprise system from one major version to another,
for example, from SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5 to SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server 15 SP3. For a service pack upgrade from one Service Pack
(SP) to another within a given major version release series the existing
Zypper migration workflow provides the supported upgrade path.
The distribution migration system provides the ability to upgrade across
major distributions without the need to use the next major version
installation media to perform the system upgrade.

The upgrade is done via the network using the Zypper migration workflow which
sends a request to the repository server, asking for an upgrade path.
SUSE supported repository servers are the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) and the
Repository Management Tool (RMT). The request response contains the list of
repositories required to upgrade the system. This requires the system to be
upgraded to be registered. Additionally the server providing the updates must
have the necessary channels available and those channels must be up to date.
This requirement is automatically met when a system is registered to the
SUSE Customer Center (SCC). However administrative work may be required when
the system to be upgraded is connected to an RMT server. The migration
implementation also supports an upgrade mode that works with systems not
registered to a repository service. For details,
see <<Optional Customization of the Upgrade Process>>.

The upgrade to a new major version requires the system to be migrated to
be offline during the upgrade to avoid system inconsistencies that may
leave the system in a state that does not allow recovery. This behavior
is implemented using a Live Migration Image.

The distribution migration system provides the live image and a startup
utility named: `run_migration` which reboots the running system into the
upgrade live image. Once booted into the upgrade live image the following
chain of services will be executed:

1. Detect the system to be upgraded
2. Mount the necessary file systems
3. Setup the network to match the network configuration of the
   system to be upgraded
4. Prepare SSH access to the upgrade live image
5. Prepare the package manager for the upgrade task
6. Upgrade the system using zypper
7. Update the boot loader configuration
8. Unmount all mounted file systems
9. Reboot

In case an error occurs prior to the start of the upgrade the system will
be reverted to its original state.

== Upgrade Prerequisites
Requirement for using the Zypper migration workflow::
Systems that are to be upgraded need to be registered.
"Pay as you go"-instances in the Public Cloud are automatically registered
to the SUSE operated update infrastructure. All other systems must be
connected to the SUSE Customer Center (SCC) or a
Repository Management tool (RMT) server. For systems
managed via SUSE Manager, use the upgrade path provided by SUSE Manager. The
server that provides the repositories must have the appropriate repositories
synched and they must be up to date. This requirement is automatically met by
the SUSE update infrastructure in the Public Cloud and by SCC.

Recommendation for SSH access during upgrade::
During the upgrade, it is only possible to log in via SSH key-based login.
If your system is not configured for it, it is recommended that at least
one of the users on the system has a `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` file with a
private key accessible by the person executing the system upgrade.

Requirement for root filesystem::
Root "/" and all core OS functional folders such as /var, /etc, /usr must
be on a single partition. Multiple partition support, such as LVM, is limited
to configurations where the separated partitions do not contain OS critical
data or processes. For example, DMS will function if /home is its own
partition, but not if /var is on a separate partition from root.

SLES Version Support::
Upgrade is supported from SLES12 SP5 to SLES 15 SP3. It is possible to
configure other versions of SLES as the migration target, but doing so
is not a tested or supported use case.

Support for SLES12 SP4 will end December 31 2023. From 2024 onward
SLES12 SP5 is the only supported migration starting point.

== Upgrade Pre-Checks
The suse-migration-pre-checks package contains the `suse-migration-pre-checks`
script that checks for possible incompatibilities when doing a migration.

These incompatibilities include:

1. Encrypted file systems
2. Invalid repository types
3. multiversion.kernels enabled and multiple kernels installed

This script is run during the install of SLES15-Migration. It can
also be run anytime using

 /usr/bin/suse-migration-pre-checks

The script must be run as root.

A `-f/--fix` option that will remediate the following issues:

1. Set multiversion.kernels to the correct value and remove all
old (not currently running) kernels.

Example output from running suse-migration-pre-checks:

== Installation
The distribution migration system is available from the Public Cloud module.
Therefore this module has to be enabled on the system prior to upgrade.
For running on-demand instances this module is already enabled.

[NOTE]
For data center customers it is recommended to continue to use the
documented offline distribution upgrade using the next distribution
version installation media.

The distribution migration process can be invoked using different methods.
One method of activating the migration is the `run_migration` included with
the SLES15-Migration package. The second method to invoking the migration
process is via reboot after installing the suse-migration-sle15-activation
package.

Option 1 - Trigger via run_migration::
+
[listing]
----
tux > sudo zypper in SLES15-Migration
----
+
The `run_migration` uses `kexec` to boot into the kernel delivered with the
upgrade image delivered by the SLES15-Migration package. Once this system
is live after the `kexec` the distribution migration process is automatically
started. However, `kexec` is not supported and does not function in certain
conditions. The `run_migration` utility does not work in Xen based
environments.
+
If kexec causes a kernel panic this can cause the system to hang and the 
distribution migration to fail. In that case refer to this TID:
https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000019733
And set the "soft_reboot" customization option:
+
[listing]
----
echo "soft_reboot: false" >> /etc/sle-migration-service.yml
----

Option 2 - Trigger via reboot::
+
[listing]
----
tux > sudo zypper in SLES15-Migration suse-migration-sle15-activation
----
+
Starting the migration via reboot after installing the
suse-migration-sle15-activation package covers the Xen use case but does
not work in cases where there is no direct access to the root file system
from the bootloader or on architectures other than x86_64. During
installation of the suse-migration-sle15-activation package the bootloader
configuration is modified  such that on the next boot the system will boot
into the upgrade image. This in turns starts the automated distribution
migration process.

== Optional Customization of the Upgrade Process
The upgrade live image is pre-configured to run without any further
setup. The migration system reads a custom configuration file from the
system to be upgraded. The content of this file modifies the behavior of the
upgrade process. Prior to the start of the upgrade process, create the
following file if a change of the default behavior is needed:

[listing]
----
tux > ssh INSTANCE_USER@IP_OF_INSTANCE 'touch /etc/sle-migration-service.yml'
----

The custom config file supports the following settings:

Control Zypper Installation Mode::
If the upgrade process is used on systems that are not registered
or for which the repository server has no upgrade path, it's required to
switch off the use of the migration workflow.
+
[listing]
----
use_zypper_migration: true|false
----
+
[NOTE]
The use of the migration workflow is the default behavior. If the migration
workflow is not used, the setup of the repositories must be performed
manually. Once done, the upgrade process uses `zypper dup` and expects
all required repositories to be setup correctly.

Specify Migration Product::
By default the system will be migrated to SLES15 SP3. This default
target can be changed via the `migration_product` setting.
The product must be specified with the triplet `name/version/arch`
found in '/etc/products.d/baseproduct' of the target product,
for example:
+
[listing]
----
migration_product: SLES/15.3/x86_64
----
+
[WARNING]
Changing the default product leads to unsupported territory and
is not tested nor covered by the SUSE support offering !
The specified product name must be supported by the repository
server used for the migration. If the given product does not
exist or the repository server cannot calculate an upgrade
path, an error message from the repository server will be
logged in the migration log file. Also see:
https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP6/html/SLES-all/cha-upgrade-background.html[Lifecycle and support]

Preserve System Data::
Preserve custom data file(s) e.g. udev rules from the system
to be migrated into the upgrade live system and make sure
they will become effective.
+
Under preserve section, there are two subsections: rules and static.
The difference between 'rules' and 'static' sections is that files preserved as
udev rules will also make the DMS to reload udev and its rules to make the new
rule set effective, while the files in the static section are copied with no
further action.
+
[listing]
----
preserve:
  rules:
    - /etc/udev/rules.d/a.rules
    - /etc/udev/rules.d/b.rules
  static:
    - /etc/sysconfig/proxy
    - /path/to/be/preserved/file
----
+
[NOTE]
udev rules that require custom drivers will not have the desired effect
as the migration system will not include these drivers and therefore
execution of those rules will fail. Rules with such properties should
not be listed.

Enable Debug Mode::
If enabled, prevents the upgrade system from rewinding the setup
steps and rebooting due to a failed upgrade, allowing the issue to
be debugged.
+
[listing]
----
debug: true|false
----

Configure Reboot Method::
By default, the migration system uses `kexec` to boot back into the host
system once migration is complete.  If this is in any way problematic,
a regular `reboot` can be requested by setting `soft_reboot: false`.
+
[listing]
----
soft_reboot: true|false
----

Enable verbosity for zypper migration::
If enabled, it will run the zypper migration plugin with increased verbosity.
+
[listing]
----
verbose_migration: true|false
----

Enable the fix option for pre_checks::
If enabled (default), the run_pre_checks systemd process will use the `--fix`
option to automatically remediate applicable issues before the migration
is started. 
+
[listing]
----
pre_checks_fix: true|false
----

Configure Make initrd Method::
The live system may not contain all necessary tools to create an initrd that
meets the need of the system being upgraded. Building a host independent
initrd will create an initrd in a way that contains the tools and
modules available on the system being upgraded. If this is needed, a host
independent initrd can be created by setting
`build_host_independent_initrd: True`.
+
[listing]
----
build_host_independent_initrd: true|false
----

Configure Dependency Solver Test Case Generation::
It is possible that during the migration packages get installed that were not
on the system previously and are pulled in because of dependencies. This
setting will setup the migration such that a solver test case is generated.
The information form the test case can then be used to understand why a
given package was installed.
+
[listing]
----
debug_solver: true|false
----

== Run the Migration
Migration can be triggered either via run_migration or via reboot.

Option 1 - Running Migration via run_migration::
After the install of the `SLES15-Migration` package, start the migration
process by calling the following command:
+
[listing]
----
tux > sudo run_migration
----

Option 2 - Running Migration via reboot::
+
[NOTE]
If using the `reboot` method to start migration, reboot the system:
+
[listing]
----
tux > sudo reboot
----

After Migration has been triggered via either method::
+
[NOTE]
After the upgrade has started, the only way to access the system during the
upgrade process is via ssh with a user called `migration`:
+
[listing]
----
tux > sudo ssh migration@IP_OF_INSTANCE
----
+
[NOTE]
There is no need to provide any other information or key. The known SSH
keys on the system to be upgraded have been imported into the upgrade system.
Password-based login is not possible.

== After the Migration
Whether the upgrade succeeded or not, a log file is available in
`/var/log/distro_migration.log` and it will contain information about the
upgrade process. If the upgrade failed, the file `/etc/issue` will contain
a pointer to the respective log file.

In addition, the distribution migration RPM packages `SLES15-Migration`
and `suse-migration-sle15-activation` will be removed.
This is to prevent the migration from being run multiple times and causing
a failure loop.
To start the migration again, the RPMs will need to be reinstalled following
the commands from the Installation Section of this document.

== Caveats and Unsupported Conditions
* Configuration files that have been modified in the original system will
  not be overwritten by the upgrade process. The new version of the respective
  configuration file will be copied into the same directory with the file
  name extension `.rpmnew`. It is recommended to compare the existing and
  the new configuration files and make manual adjustments when needed.
* Repositories not registered via `SUSEConnect` and added to the system
  manually will remain untouched.
* Upgrade is only possible for systems that use unencrypted root file systems,
  at the OS level. Encrypting the root device using a cloud framework
  encryption mechanism happens at a different level.
* Upgrade has been tested for SLES 12 SP5 to SLES 15 SP3
* The system is primarily intended for Public Cloud instance upgrade use. The
  system also works for simple setups in a data center setting on physical
  installations. However, for any more complex configurations the off line
  upgrade path via install ISO file should be used as documented in the
  SUSE Linux Enterprise Server documentation.
* In systems that contain multiple root file systems on different mount points
  only the root file system mounted on `/` (primary system) will be migrated.
* Upgrade is not supported for systems having the SLE 12 HPC module installed.
  In SLE 15, HPC is no longer a module but rather a product. With this change,
  there is not a migration path from SLE 12 (with the HPC module) to SLE 15 HPC.

=== Public and Private Cloud Specific
* Migration initiation for a cloud instance is only supported via a reboot.
  The required GRUB changes to make this process are automated and
  provided with the suse-migration-sle15-activation package. We recommend
  to use the provided automation.
* Public Cloud instances from SUSE images have a custom `/etc/motd` file
  that makes a reference to the distribution version. This needs to be
  updated manually after the upgrade.
* The instance metadata will not change. As far as the
  cloud framework is concerned, you will still be running an instance
  of the SLES version you started with. This cannot be changed.
* The default migration path in the Public Cloud is from the final service
  pack of SLES 12 (SP5) to SLES 15 SP3. The target may be changed by the
  customer to service packs greater than SP3, but the source may not be
  earlier than 12 SP5.
